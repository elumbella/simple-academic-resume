# simple academic resume
This is a fork and extension of the Simple Academic CV from latex-ninja

It has been boiled down to one version which is modular and extensible.
The different parts have (mostly) been separated into minipages for easier positioning.
Images have been removed from cvdegree and cvevent for more room for text.

Additionally, there is now a letter at the end!
